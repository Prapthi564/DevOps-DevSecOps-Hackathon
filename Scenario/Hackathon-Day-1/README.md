# DevOps/DevSecOps Challenge: 1-Day Attendee Guide

Welcome to the DevSecOps Mastery with GitHub Hackathon! This event is your gateway to mastering DevSecOps practices within a modern application environment. We have crafted this hackathon to provide you with a robust learning experience focused on Contoso Traders, a hypothetical e-commerce company using a React front-end, .NET back-end, and various microservices and container services.

Your goal is to integrate DevSecOps practices into Contoso Traders' existing e-commerce application. As you navigate through various challenges, you will gain practical experience in implementing DevSecOps in an application built with a modern tech stack.


## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will:

Master the art of Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) for .NET applications using GitHub Actions. Enhance code security and manage dependencies effectively. Integrate and optimize monitoring solutions with Azure Monitor and Application Insights. Execute resilience testing to ensure application robustness. Utilize AI-powered GitHub Actions to strengthen security checks and compliance within pipelines. Leverage GitHub Copilot to harness AI for improved code completion and testing efficiency
