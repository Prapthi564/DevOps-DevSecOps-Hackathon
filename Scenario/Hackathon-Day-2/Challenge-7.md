# Challenge 04: Integrate 'About Us' Page with GitHub Copilot in React Application  

### Estimated Time: 60 minutes

### Introduction:
In this challenge, you will be improving a React Application. As a DevOps engineer, your focus is to seamlessly implement and test new app features with Copilot, ensuring accuracy and alignment. Conduct a thorough code review and enhance security using GitHub Advanced Security's CodeQL. Streamline development with a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for a React application, ensuring efficient and secure deployment.

## Challenge Objectives:

>**Note:** In this challenge, you are provided with a simple React application present in the path `C:\Workspaces\lab\DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files-2\ContosoTraders.Ui.Website.V2.Raw`.

1. **Integrate an 'About Us' app component in React using GitHub Copilot:**
   - You are provided with a simple React application which needs to be deployed and hosted on Azure.
   - You can navigate to the `C:\Workspaces\lab\DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files-2\ContosoTraders.Ui.Website.V2.Raw` directory and then ensure to select the `ContosoTraders.Ui.Website.V2` folder to import the complete code base of the application.
   - Enhance the user interface by designing and integrating an **About Us** page app component within the existing imported React application using **GitHub Copilot**.
   - Ensure that the React Application is up and running with the newly integrated **About Us** page, locally on `http://localhost:3000/`.

2. **Generate and run Unit Test cases using GitHub Coplilot:**
   - Generate Unit Test cases using GitHub Copilot for the `WelcomePopup.js` file present in the path `ContosoTraders.Ui.Wesite.V2/src/`.
   - Create a new test file named `WelcomePopup.test.js` to run the unit test cases.
   - Ensure that the generated test cases are aligning with the code analogy with successful test passes.
   - Resolve any unit test failures with the help of GitHub Copilot chat. 

3. **Code Review and Security Check:**
   - Perform a code review and on the new feature implemented using GitHub Copilot.
   >**Hint:** Focus areas include code readability, adherence to best practices, and ensuring that the new feature aligns with the existing codebase.
   - Run a security check on the newly implemented code using GitHub Advanced Security features thus resolving any alerts to vulnerabilities and catch any potential security issues using CodeQL over the repository.

5. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup and Infrastructure Deployment:**
   - Host the React Application with the new app component over Azure using **Static Web Apps** through GitHub Actions.
   - Ensure that the **Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD** GitHub workflow is successful. 

## Success criteria:
To complete this challenge successfully:

- Successful implementation of the new feature.
- Accuracy and completeness of the generated unit tests with all successful passes.
- Successful setup and execution of the CI/CD pipeline.
