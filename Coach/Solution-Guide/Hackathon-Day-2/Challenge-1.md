# Challenge 01: Continuous Integration and Deployment for Contoso Traders using GitHub Actions

## Introduction
This challenge is designed to evaluate the attendee/user skills in creating a robust CI/CD pipeline leveraging GitHub Actions. It aims to assess your capability to not only establish a seamless pipeline but also to guarantee the successful deployment of the application. Through this challenge, the attendee/user will set up a GitHub repository, implement a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions, deploy a .NET application to Azure, and make rolling updates to the application.
